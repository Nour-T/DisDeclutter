# DisDeclutter
A Discord CSS "theme" designed to declutter some of the less used functions of the client.

What are those functions, you may ask? Simple! Things such as the help and mention button on the chat toolbar, Library and Nitro on Home menu, the GIF picker and Gifiting Nitro on the chat messagebox, and even the notes on the profile info!
